CS-300-11582-M01- DSA: Analysis and Design

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I was trying to solve the problem for academic advisors in the Computer Science department at ABCU. 
To load the course list, sort and display course id, course name and prerequisites.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I considered 3 data structures to use, Vector, Hash table and Binary search tree, did the analysis for each "O" notation for performance for all operations. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Setting up the Visual Studio and some programming task were the roadblocks. I read and re-read the announments and followed the instructions.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
It has helped me understand that writing good pseudocode is necessary with data structures etc.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Refering the programs templates provided in the course has helped understand how code should be written.
